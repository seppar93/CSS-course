`postion` 
    => `static` 
    `absolute`
    `relative`
    `fixed`
    `sticky`
we are specifying we want to change the position. They can be position in all 4 directions 
you are changing their position in the document flow defining the positioning context

apply changes to position will only take place if they are different from static

for inline elements changing the width has no impact 

fixed naviagtion can be done by setting the position to fixed making the element stick to the viewport
